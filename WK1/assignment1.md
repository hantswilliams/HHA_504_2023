## **Homework Assignment: Exploring Microsoft Azure**

### **Objective**:
To familiarize yourself with the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, its core services, and basic integration points with Python. This assignment will also introduce you to using GitHub as a medium for submitting assignments.

### **Instructions**:

#### **Part 1: Registration**
1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) page.
2. Register for a free student account using your .edu email address. You may be prompted to verify your student status.
3. Once registered and logged in, take a screenshot of your Azure Dashboard. This will be used to verify that you've successfully registered.

#### **Part 2: Azure Exploration**
1. Visit the Azure documentation: [Azure Learning Resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/)
2. Based on the documentation, and for each of the core categories (Storage, Compute, Database services), perform the following:

   a. **Identify & List Services**: Choose at least two distinct services under each category.
   
   b. **Service Description**: Write a brief description for each chosen service based on the official documentation.
   
   c. **Python Interaction**: Describe how you may or could interact with this service using Python. You don't need to write any code, but hint towards how Python could be used to leverage this service (e.g., through SDKs, APIs, etc.).

#### **Part 3: Submission via GitHub**:
1. Create a new GitHub repository named `azure_intro_assessment`.
2. In your repository, upload the screenshot from Part 1 to show that you've successfully logged into your Azure environment.
3. Create a markdown file in your repository named `azure.md`.
   
   - Use this file to provide your answers from Part 2.
   - For reference on how to format markdown files, you can refer to the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
   
4. Once you've added both items to your repository, ensure it's public and share the link as your submission for this assignment.

**Note**: Throughout this course, it's good practice to regularly commit your changes to GitHub. It's not only a version control tool but also serves as a portfolio of your work.
