## **Homework Assignment: Dockerizing Flask Applications**

### **Objective**:
Understanding Docker is crucial for modern software deployment. This assignment focuses on containerizing your Flask applications with Docker, offering hands-on experience with Docker and Docker Compose.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Dockerizing Your Flask Applications**:
- Choose two versions of your Flask application for Dockerization.
  - **Version 1:** Could be a simple "Hello World" Flask app.
  - **Version 2:** A more complex version of your Flask app, possibly with additional features or complexities.
- Create Dockerfiles for both versions of your application.
  - Document the steps taken to create the Dockerfiles.
  - Explain the purpose of each command in your Dockerfiles.

#### **2. Building and Running Your Docker Containers**:
- Build Docker images for both versions of your Flask application.
- Run the Docker containers locally and ensure they are functioning correctly.
- Document any challenges or observations noted during the building and running process.

#### **3. (Optional) Using Docker Compose**:
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to run both versions of your Flask application simultaneously.
  - Include comments in the file to explain its structure and settings.
  - Run your applications using Docker Compose and document any observations.

#### **4. Reflection**:
- Reflect on the experience of Dockerizing your applications.
  - What benefits did Docker bring to your deployment process?
  - How did Docker solve the issues related to different operating systems, Python, and OS versions?
  - Discuss any challenges faced and how you overcame them.

### **Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `docker_flask_assignment`.
- The GitHub repository should contain:
  - Dockerfiles for both versions of your Flask application.
  - `docker-compose.yml` file, if you completed the optional task.
  - A detailed README.md file explaining:
    - The process of Dockerizing your Flask applications.
    - Any challenges faced and how they were resolved.
    - Reflections on using Docker and Docker Compose.
- Provide the link to your repository as your assignment submission.
- Ensure your repository is public for evaluation purposes.

**Tips**: 
- Document your process thoroughly. It's a valuable exercise in understanding Docker and helps in troubleshooting.
- Don't hesitate to experiment with different configurations in your Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml.
