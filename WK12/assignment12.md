## **Week 12 Homework Assignment: Cloud Security Practices**

### **Objective**:
Security is of paramount importance in the modern web landscape. As developers, it's essential to be aware of potential vulnerabilities and take proactive steps to safeguard applications. This week, you'll delve into the realm of cloud security, best practices for environment variable management, and the responsibilities of cloud service providers and developers.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Secure Environment Management**:
- Integrate `.env` files into the Hospital Priceline application.
  - Ensure that sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and other secrets are not stored in plaintext within your codebase.
  - Implement necessary configurations to ensure that `.env` files are not pushed to your public repositories.

#### **2. Cloud Security Assessment**:
- Choose either Azure Security Center or Google Cloud Security Command Center based on your deployment.
  - Run a security assessment on your Hospital Priceline deployment.
  - Document any findings, vulnerabilities, or threats.
  - Propose and discuss potential solutions or mitigations to address each identified security concern.

#### **3. Shared Responsibility Model**:
- Conduct research on the 'Shared Responsibility' model in cloud computing.
  - Write a brief essay (500-700 words) explaining:
    - The concept of the Shared Responsibility model.
    - Its significance in the world of cloud computing.
    - The implications for both developers and businesses using cloud platforms.

#### **4. Application Vulnerability Analysis**:
- Analyze your Hospital Priceline application to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
  - Highlight at least 3 vulnerabilities, potential threats, or areas of concern.
  - For each vulnerability:
    - Describe the potential risks or threats it poses.
    - Propose a solution or mitigation strategy to address it.
    - Discuss an implementation strategy or steps to secure the identified vulnerability.

### **Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `flask_12_security` in your GitHub account.
- Feel free to re-use parts of your code from prior assignments where necessary 
- The GitHub repository should contain:    
  - All updated source code and configuration files.
  - Visual evidence like screenshots or video recordings showcasing the secure environment management and the findings from the cloud security assessment.
  - Your essay on the Shared Responsibility model.
  - Your application vulnerability analysis report.
  - A detailed README.md file that:
    - Summarizes your activities, integrations, and observations for this week's assignment.
    - Offers reflections on the importance of cloud security and challenges encountered.
- Provide the link to your repository as your assignment submission.
- Ensure your repository is set to public for ease of review.

**Tip**: The world of cloud security is ever-evolving, with new threats emerging daily. Regularly reviewing security practices, staying updated with industry best practices, and proactively safeguarding applications can minimize potential risks.
