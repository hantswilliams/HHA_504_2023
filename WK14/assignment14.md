## **Week 14 Final Homework Assignment: Hospital Priceline - Final Deliverable**

### **Objective**:
You are to enhance the Hospital Priceline application by designing and implementing at least two new features. This assignment will test your cumulative knowledge from the entire course, pushing you to synergize various cloud resources and tools.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Feature Design and Implementation**:
- Develop at least two new features for the Hospital Priceline application. You can choose from the list of suggested features below or propose your own.
- Ensure the features utilize the cloud services and tools discussed throughout the course, showcasing your understanding of them.

#### **2. Integration and Testing**:
- Ensure that the new features are well-integrated with the existing Hospital Priceline system.
- Test each feature to ensure that they work correctly, are scalable, and don't introduce any new issues or vulnerabilities.

#### **3. Final Presentation**:
- Prepare a presentation that showcases:
  - The entirety of the Hospital Priceline application.
  - The enhanced functionalities and features.
  - A clear demonstration of the cloud services used and how they benefited the application.
  - An explanation of the relevance and importance of the chosen features, detailing how they improve the user experience or provide added utility.

### **Suggested Features**:

1. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use libraries like `matplotlib`, `bokeh`, or `plotly` to visualize the hospital pricing data, offering users insights at a glance.

2. **ML/AI Integration**:
   - Utilize `scikit-learn` or `tensorflow` to predict future hospital pricing or to spot anomalies in the data which might suggest errors or outlier events.

3. **Social Media Sharing**:
   - Implement social sharing capabilities using extensions like `Flask-Dance`. Enable users to share interesting pricing insights on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn.

4. **Feedback System**:
   - Create a mechanism for users to provide feedback or rate data points. This can help understand user preferences and improve the system accordingly.

5. **Notifications**:
   - Integrate services like `Twilio` for SMS notifications or `SendGrid` for email notifications. Notify users about significant pricing changes, helping them make timely decisions.

### **Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `flask_14_hospital_priceline` in your GitHub account.
- Feel free to re-use parts of your code from prior assignments where necessary 
- The GitHub repository should contain:    
  - The enhanced application with the new features.
  - Any additional configuration files, libraries, or tools you integrated.
  - A README.md file that explains the new features, the reasons for their selection, their utility, and a brief user guide.
  - Visual evidence, either through screenshots or video recordings, that display the features in action.
- Include your presentation slides or materials.
- Share the link to your repository and any hosted versions of your application.

**Tip**: Always consider user feedback, even from your peers or instructors. It's an invaluable tool in understanding user needs and iterating on your design.
